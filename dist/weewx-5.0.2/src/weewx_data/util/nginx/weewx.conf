# Use a configuration like this to make WeeWX reports show up in an nginx
# web server.  This makes the URL '/weewx' serve files from the directory
# '/home/weewx/public_html' - adjust as appropriate for your WeeWX install.
# Place this file in the appropriate place within your nginx web server
# configuration, typically the 'conf.d' or 'conf-enabled' directory.
