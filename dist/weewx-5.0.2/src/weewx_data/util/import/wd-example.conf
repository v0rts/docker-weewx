[WD]
    # Parameters used when importing WD monthly log files
    #
    # Directory containing WD monthly log files to be imported. Format is:
    #   directory = full path without trailing /
    directory = /var/tmp/WD

    # WD uses multiple log files some of which are in space delimited text
    # format, some are in csv format and some in both. wee_import can process
    # the following WD log files (actual log file names have 5 or 6 digits
    # prepended representing a 1 or 2 digit month and a 4 digit year, these
    # digits have been omitted for clarity):
    #   - lg.txt (same content as lgcsv.csv)
    #   - lgcsv.csv (same content as lg.txt)
    #   - vantageextrasensorslog.csv
    #   - vantagelog.txt (same content as vantagelogcsv.csv)
    #   - vantagelogcsv.csv (same content as vantagelog.txt)
    # Specify log files to be imported. Format is a comma separated list
    # including at least one of the supported log files. Do not include
    # prepended month and year digits. Default is lg.txt, vantagelog.txt
    # and vantageextrasensorslog.csv.
    logs_to_process = lg.txt, vantagelog.txt, vantageextrasensorslog.csv

    # Specify the character used as the field delimiter in .txt monthly log
    # files. Normally set to the space character. The character must be
    # enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same as the decimal setting below.
    # Format is:
    #   txt_delimiter = '<single character>'
    # Default is ' ' (space).
    txt_delimiter = ' '

    # Specify the character used as the field delimiter in .csv monthly log
    # files. Normally set to a comma. The character must be enclosed in
    # quotes. Must not be the same as the decimal setting below. Format is:
    #   csv_delimiter = '<single character>'
    # Default is ',' (comma).
    csv_delimiter = ','

    # Specify the character used as the decimal point. WD monthly log files
    # normally use a periodr as the decimal point. The character must be
    # enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same as the txt_delimiter or
    # csv_delimiter settings. Format is:
    #   decimal = '<single character>'
    # Default is '.' (period).
    decimal = '.'

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.
    # Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when there are no missing
    #            records from period being imported. Missing records will
    #            cause the interval field to be incorrectly calculated for some
    #            records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX or some other means with the same archive interval as
    #            set in weewx.conf on this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of 'x' minutes for every record where 'x'
    #            is a number. This setting is best used if the records to be
    #            imported are equally spaced in time but there are some missing
    #            records.
    # To import WD monthly log data it is recommended that the interval setting
    # be set to 1.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    # Default is 1.
    interval = 1

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    calc_missing = True

    # Specify whether missing log files are to be ignored or abort the import.
    # WD log files are complete in themselves and a missing log file will have
    # no effect on any other records (eg rain as a delta).
    # Format is:
    #   ignore_missing_log = (True | False)
    # Default is True
    ignore_missing_log = True

    # Specify how imported data fields that contain invalid data (eg a numeric
    # field containing non-numeric data) are handled. Available options are:
    #   True  - The invalid data is ignored, the WeeWX target field is set to
    #           None and the import continues.
    #   False - The import is halted.
    # Format is:
    #   ignore_invalid_data = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    ignore_invalid_data = True

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of tranche
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    # Default is 250.
    tranche = 250

    # Specify whether a UV sensor was used to produce UV observation data.
    # Available options are:
    #   True  - UV sensor was used and UV data will be imported.
    #   False - UV sensor was not used and any UV data will not be imported.
    #           UV field will be set to None/NULL.
    # For a WD monthly log file import UV_sensor should be set to False if a UV
    # sensor was NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise it may
    # be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   UV_sensor = (True | False)
    # The default is True.
    UV_sensor = True

    # Specify whether a solar radiation sensor was used to produce solar
    # radiation observation data. Available options are:
    #   True  - Solar radiation sensor was used and solar radiation data will
    #           be imported.
    #   False - Solar radiation sensor was not used and any solar radiation
    #           data will not be imported. radiation field will be set to
    #           None/NULL.
    # For a WD monthly log file import solar_sensor should be set to False if a
    # solar radiation sensor was NOT present when the import data was created.
    # Otherwise it may be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   solar_sensor = (True | False)
    # The default is True.
    solar_sensor = True

    # Specify whether to ignore temperature and humidity reading of 255.0.
    # WD logs can include values of 255.0 or 255. These values are usually
    # associated with an absent or disconnected senor. In WeeWX the lack of a
    # sensor/sensor data results in the value None (or null in SQL) being
    # recorded. If ignore_extreme_temp_hum is set to True temperature and
    # humidity values of 255 are ignored. Format is:
    #   ignore_extreme_temp_hum = (True | False)
    # The default is True
    ignore_extreme_temp_hum = True

    # Map WD fields to WeeWX archive fields. Format for each map entry is:
    #
    #   [[[weewx_archive_field_name]]]
    #       source_field = wd_field_name
    #       unit = weewx_unit_name
    #       is_cumulative = True | False
    #       is_text = True | False
    #
    # where:
    #   weewx_archive_field_name - An observation name in the WeeWX database
    #                              schema.
    #   source_field             - Config option specifying the WD field being
    #                              mapped.
    #   wd_field_name            - The name of a field from the WD log file.
    #   unit                     - Config option specifying the unit used by
    #                              the WD field being mapped.
    #   weewx_unit_name          - The WeeWX unit name for the the units used
    #                              by wd_field_name.
    #   is_cumulative            - Config option specifying whether the WD
    #                              field being mapped is cumulative,
    #                              e.g: dayrain. Optional, default value is
    #                              False.
    #   is_text                  - Config option specifying whether the WD
    #                              field being mapped is text. Optional,
    #                              default value is False.
    # For example,
    #   [[[outTemp]]]
    #       source_field = temperature
    #       unit = degree_C
    # would map the WD field 'temperature', in degrees C, to the WeeWX archive
    # field 'outTemp'.
    #
    # A mapping for WeeWX field 'dateTime' is mandatory and the WeeWX unit name
    # for the 'dateTime' mapping must be 'unix_epoch'. For example,
    #   [[[dateTime]]]
    #       source_field = datetime
    #       unit = unix_epoch
    # would map the WD field 'datetime' to the WeeWX 'dateTime' field.
    #
    # WeeWX archive fields that do not exist in the WD data may be omitted. Any
    # omitted fields that are derived (eg 'dewpoint') may be calculated during
    # import using the equivalent of the WeeWX StdWXCalculate service through
    # setting the 'calc-missing' parameter above.
    #
    # An example field map stanza is provided below. Once the units are
    # adjusted this field map should suit most users but can be tailored to
    # suit specific needs.
