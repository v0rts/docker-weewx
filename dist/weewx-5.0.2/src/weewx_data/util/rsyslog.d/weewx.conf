# Put messages from WeeWX into file(s) separate from the system log file

# If you want log messages from each application in a separate file,
# then uncomment the following two lines, and comment the weewx.log line.
#$template WEEWX_LOGFILE,"/var/log/weewx/%programname%.log"
#if $programname startswith 'wee' then ?WEEWX_LOGFILE

# Put log messages from all WeeWX applications into a single file
if $programname startswith 'wee' then /var/log/weewx/weewx.log

# Finish the WeeWX rules
if $programname startswith 'wee' then stop
