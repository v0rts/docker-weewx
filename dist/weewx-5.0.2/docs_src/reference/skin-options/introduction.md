# Skin options

The skin configuration options control report behavior, including:

* how files and plots are generated
* how files and plots look
* how data are displayed
* how units are displayed
* which language is used

Options that control the behavior of a skin are specified in the skin
configuration file `skin.conf`.

Language-dependent labels and texts are specified in the language files,
located in the skin's `lang` directory.

UTF-8 is used throughout the skin configuration file, just as it is
throughout the WeeWX configuration file.
