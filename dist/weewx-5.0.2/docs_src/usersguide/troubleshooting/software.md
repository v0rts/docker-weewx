# Software problems

## Nothing in the log file

As it is running, WeeWX periodically sends status information, failures, and
other things to your system's logging facility. They typically look something
like this (the first line is not actually part of the log):

``` log
 DATE    TIME       HOST    weewx[PID]  LEVL MESSAGE
Feb  8 04:25:16 hummingbird weewx[6932] INFO weewx.manager: Added record 2020-02-08 04:25:00 PST (1581164700) to database 'weewx.sdb'

Feb  8 04:25:17 hummingbird weewx[6932] INFO weewx.restx: Windy: Published record 2020-02-08 04:25:00 PST (1581164700)
Feb  8 04:25:17 hummingbird weewx[6932] ERROR weewx.restx: WOW: Failed to publish record 2020-02-08 04:25:00 PST (1581164700): Failed upload after 3 tries
```

The location of this logging file varies from system to system, but it is
typically in `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`.

However, some systems default to saving only warning or critical information, so
**INFO** messages from WeeWX may not appear. If this happens to you, check your
system logging configuration. On Debian systems, look in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`. On
Redhat systems, look in `/etc/syslog.conf`.


## ConfigObj errors

These are errors in the configuration file. Two are very common. Incidentally,
these errors are far easier to diagnose when WeeWX is run directly from the
command line than when it is run as a daemon.

### Exception `configobj.DuplicateError`

This error is caused by using an identifier more than once in the configuration
file. For example, you may have inadvertently listed your FTP server twice:

```ini
[Reports]
    [[FTP]]
        ... (details elided)
        user = fred
        server = ftp.myhost.com
        password = mypassword
        server = ftp.myhost.com      # OOPS! Listed it twice!
        path = /weather
...
```

Generally, if you encounter this error, the log file will give you the line
number it happened in:

``` log
Apr 24 12:09:15 raven weewx[11480]: wxengine: Error while parsing configuration file /home/weewx/weewx.conf
Apr 24 12:09:15 raven weewx[11480]: wxengine: Unable to initialize main loop:
Apr 24 12:09:15 raven weewx[11480]: **** Duplicate keyword name at line 254.
Apr 24 12:09:15 raven weewx[11480]: **** Exiting. 
```

### Exception `configobj.NestingError`

This is a very similar error, and is caused by a misformed section nesting. For
example:

```ini
[Reports]
    [[FTP]]]
        ...
```

Note the extra closing bracket on the subsection `FTP`.


## No barometer data

If everything appears normal except that you have no barometer data, the problem
may be a mismatch between the unit system used for service `StdConvert` and the
unit system used by service `StdQC`. For example:

```ini
[StdConvert]
    target_unit = METRIC
    ...

[StdQC]
    [[MinMax]]
        barometer = 28, 32.5
```

The problem is that you are requiring the barometer data to be between 28 and
32.5, but with the unit system set to `METRIC`, the data will be in the range
990 to 1050 or so!

The solution is to change the values to match the units in `StdConvert`, or,
better yet, specify the units in `MinMax`. For example:

```ini hl_lines="7"
[StdConvert]
    target_unit = US
    ...

[StdQC]
    [[MinMax]]
        barometer = 950, 1100, mbar
```

## Exception `Cheetah.NameMapper.NotFound`

If you get errors of the sort:

``` log
Apr 12 05:12:32 raven reportengine[3074]: filegenerator: Caught exception "<class 'NameMapper.NotFound'>"
Apr 12 05:12:32 raven reportengine[3074]: **** Message: "cannot find 'fubar' in template /home/weewx/skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl"
Apr 12 05:12:32 raven reportengine[3074]: **** Ignoring template and continuing.
```

you have a tag in your template that WeeWX does not recognize. In this example,
it is the tag `$fubar` in the template
`/home/weewx/skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl`.


## Dots in the plots

If you see dots instead of lines in the daily plots, you might want to change
the graphing options or adjust the station's archive interval.

In a default configuration, a time period greater than 1% of the displayed
timespan is considered to be a gap in data. So when the interval between data
points is greater than about 10 minutes, the daily plots show dots instead of
connected points.

Change the option
[`line_gap_fraction`](../../reference/skin-options/imagegenerator.md#line_gap_fraction)
in `skin.conf` to control how much time is considered a break in data.

As for the archive interval, check the log file for an entry like this soon
after WeeWX starts up:

```
Dec 30 10:54:17 saga weewx[10035]: wxengine: The archive interval in the configuration file
            (300) does not match the station hardware interval (1800).
Dec 30 10:54:17 saga weewx[10035]: wxengine: Using archive interval of 1800
```

In this example, the interval specified in `weewx.conf` is 5 minutes, but the
interval specified in the station hardware is 30 minutes. When the interval in
`weewx.conf` does not match the station's hardware interval, WeeWX defers to the
station's interval.

Use the [`weectl device`](../../utilities/weectl-device.md) utility to change
the station's interval.


## Spikes in the graphs

Occasionally you may see anomalous readings, typically manifested as spikes in
the graphs. The source could be a flaky serial/USB connection, radio or other
interference, a cheap USB-Serial adapter, low-quality sensors, or simply an
anomalous reading.

Sensor quality matters. It is not unusual for some low-end hardware to report
odd sensor readings occasionally (once every few days). Some sensors, such as
solar radiation/UV, have a limited lifespan of about 5 years. The (analog)
humidity sensors on older Vantage stations are known to deteriorate after a few
years in wet environments.

If you frequently see anomalous data, first check the hardware.

To keep bad data from the database, add a quality control (QC) rule such as
Min/Max bounds. See the section
[`[StdQC]`](../../reference/weewx-options/stdqc.md) for details.

To remove bad data from the database, see the Wiki article [_Cleaning up old 
"bad" data_](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/Cleaning-up-old-'bad'-data).


## 'Database is locked' error
This seems to be a problem with the Raspberry Pi, *when using SQLite*. There is no analogous problem with MySQL databases. You will see errors in the system log that looks like this:

``` log
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****    File "/usr/share/weewx/weewx/archive.py", line 118, in lastGoodStamp
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****      _row = self.getSql("SELECT MAX(dateTime) FROM %s" % self.table)
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****    File "/usr/share/weewx/weewx/archive.py", line 250, in getSql
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****    File "/usr/share/weewx/weedb/sqlite.py", line 120, in execute
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****      raise weedb.OperationalError(e)
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****  OperationalError: database is locked
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****      _cursor.execute(sql, sqlargs)
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****    File "/usr/share/weewx/weedb/sqlite.py", line 120, in execute
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****      raise weedb.OperationalError(e)
Feb 12 07:11:06 rpi weewx[20930]: ****  OperationalError: database is locked
```

We are still trying to decipher exactly what the problem is, but it seems that
(many? most? all?) implementations of the SQLite 'C' access libraries on the RPi
sleep for a full second if they find the database locked. This gives them only
five chances within the 5-second timeout period before an exception is raised.

Not all Raspberry Pis have this problem. It seems to be most acute when running
big templates with lots of queries, such as the forecast extension.

There are a few possible fixes:

* Increase the option
  [`timeout`](../../reference/weewx-options/databases.md#timeout).
 
* Use a high quality SD card in your RPi. There seems to be some evidence that
  faster SD cards are more immune to this problem.

* Trim the size of your templates to minimize the number of queries necessary.

None of these 'fixes' are very satisfying, and we're trying to come up with a
more robust solution.


## Funky symbols in plots

If your plots have strange looking symbols for units, such as degrees Fahrenheit
(Â°F), that look something like this:

![funky degree sign](../../images/funky_degree.png)

Then the problem may be that you are missing the fonts specified for the option `unit_label_font_path` in your `skin.conf` file and, instead, WeeWX is substituting a default font, which does not support the Unicode character necessary to make a degree sign. Look in section `[ImageGenerator]` for a line that looks like:

    unit_label_font_path = /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeMonoBold.ttf

Make sure that the specified path
(`/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeMonoBold.ttf` in this case) actually
exists. If it does not, on Debian operating systems (such as Ubuntu), you may be
able to install the necessary fonts:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install fonts-freefont-ttf
sudo fc-cache -f -v
```

(On older systems, the package `fonts-freefont-ttf` may be called
`ttf-freefont`). The first command installs the "Truetype" fonts, the second
rebuilds the font cache. If your system does not have the `fc-cache` command,
then install it from the `fontconfig` package:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install fontconfig
```

If none of this works, or if you are on a different operating system, then you
will have to change the option `unit_label_font_path` to point to something on
your system which does support the Unicode characters you plan to use.


## Exception `UnicodeEncodeError`

This problem is closely related to the ["Funky
symbols"](#funky-symbols-in-plots) problem above. In this case, you may see
errors in your log that look like:

``` log

```

This is frequently caused by the necessary Truetype fonts not being installed on
your computer and, instead, a default font is being substituted, which only
knows how to plot ASCII characters. The cure is as before: install the font.


## Data is archived but some/all reports do not run

If WeeWX appears to be running normally but some or all reports are not being
run, either all the time or periodically, the problem could be the inadvertant
use or incorrect setting of the `report_timing` option in `weewx.conf`. The
`report_timing` option allows the user to specify when some or all reports are
run (see [_Scheduling report generation_](../../custom/report-scheduling.md)).
By default, the option
[_`report_timing`_](../../reference/weewx-options/stdreport.md#report_timing)
is disabled and all reports are run each archive period.

To see if the `report_timing` option is causing reports to be skipped, inspect
the log file. Any reports that are skipped due to the `report_timing` option
will be logged as follows:

``` log
Apr 29 09:30:17 rosella weewx[3319]: reportengine: Report StandardReport skipped due to report_timing setting
```

If reports are being incorrectly skipped due to `report_timing`, then edit
`weewx.conf` and check for a `report_timing` option in `[StdReport]`. Either
remove all occurrences of `report_timing` to run all reports each archive
period, or confirm the correct use and setting of the `report_timing` option.


## The wrong reports are being skipped by report_timing

If the option
[_`report_timing`_](../../reference/weewx-options/stdreport.md#report_timing)
is being used, and the results are not as expected, there may be an error in the
`report_timing` option. If there are errors in the `report_timing` parameter,
the report will be run on each archive interval. First check the `report_timing`
option parameters to ensure they are valid and there are no additonal spaces or
other unwanted characters. Then check that the parameters are correctly set for
the desired report generation times. For example, is the correct day of the week
number being used if limiting the day of the week parameter. Refer to the
section [_Scheduling report generation_](../../custom/report-scheduling.md).


Check the log file for any entries relating to the reports concerned. Errors in
the `report_timing` parameter and skipped reports are logged only when `debug=1`
in `weewx.conf`.
