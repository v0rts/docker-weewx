# weectl import

Some WeeWX users will have historical data from  another source (e.g., other 
weather station software or a manually compiled file) which they wish to 
import into WeeWX. Such data can, depending upon the source, be imported 
using the `weectl import` utility.

The `weectl import` utility supports importing observational data from the 
following sources:

* a single [Comma Separated Values (CSV)](weectl-import-csv.md) format file
* the historical observations of a [Weather Underground](weectl-import-wu.md) 
  personal weather station
* one or more [Cumulus](weectl-import-cumulus.md) monthly log files
* one or more [Weather Display](weectl-import-wd.md) monthly log files
* one or more [WeatherCat](weectl-import-weathercat.md) monthly .cat files
